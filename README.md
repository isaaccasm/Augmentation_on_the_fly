Library to perform augmentation of images for training deep learning models during the training stage. The 
transformations will be performed in the pre-processing step.

This library is an alternative to <a href=https://github.com/mdbloice/Augmentor> Augmentor </a>, which performs 
image augmentations to be stored in memory or creates an ready to use generator
for some of the main deep learning frameworks. However, there are cases where you do not want
to store the images in memory and still use your own generator.

## Quick start guide
The purpose of this repository is to create a small library to perform image augmentation
for training deep learning networks in a flexible manner.

There are two main steps:
1. Selection of the type of augmentation and parameters.
2. Call the run function to apply to a given image.
 

## Selection of the transformation and parameters
Currently, all the operations require a range of values for each of the parameters.
This range is specified with the minimum value and maximum value that the user wants
to use. For instance, the rotation of an image would required 2 values the minimum angle
and the maximum angle. Then, an uniform distribution will be used to select a value from
the range.

In addition, most of the parameterers that represents the size (for instance translation of an image)
are going to be represented relative to the image size, so their value will be between 0 and 1.
Thus, parameters from operations like the crop that requires the size of the patch in the image is given by
number between 0 and 1. In the case of crop 4 values will be required representing the minimum width, maximum width
minimum height and maximum height, all of them relative to the image size.

A list of the current operations and parameters is:

- <b>brightness</b>: (min_value, max_value) 
                      
                      The values must be between 0.05 and 10, whereas 1 means no change.
- <b>color_balance</b>: (min_value, max_value) 

                        The values must be between 0 and 10, whereas 1 means no change.
- <b>contrast</b>: (min_value, max_value) 

                    The values must be between 0 and 10, whereas 1.0 means no change.
- <b>flip</b>: (type) 

                The type can be 'horizontal', 'vertical', 'both' or, 'random', representing the type of flip. 
                Random will select one type of flip randomly including both, which means to flip the image
                horizontally and vertical
ly.- <b>greyscale</b>: No values.
- <b>grid_mask</b>: (min_x_pos, max_x_pos, min_y_pos, max_y_pos, min_width_square, max_width_square,
            min_height_square, max_heigth_square, min_x_distance_between_squares,
            max_x_distance_between_squares, min_y_distance_between_squares, max_y_distance_between_squares)
            
            Values must be between 0 to 1 since they are relative to the size of the image.
            Generally, the initial position should be similar to the distance between squares
            This type of augmentations can be used two o three times with different parameters, since it is
            good to have a lot of different grids without having too much of the image covered.
- <b>illumination</b>: (min_radius, max_radius, min_magnitude, max_magnitude)

                        The values of radius must be between 0 and 1 representing the radius of the circle with respect 
                        to the size of the image. The magnitue values are between 0 and 255, representing the intensity
                        of the circle. Standard values are:  (0.05, 0.1, 100, 200)
- <b>noise</b>: (min_sigma, max_sigma)

                The values must be between 0 and 255 and they represent the standard deviation of the gaussian 
                distribution that is used to create the noise to be added to the image. The mean is 0
- <b>occlusion</b>: (type, min_height, max_height, min_width, max_width)

                    The are two type of occlussions:
   1. `hide_and_seek`: It creates a grid on the image and the blocks a set of patches from the grid. The number of patches
                    in the grid depends of the box size given by the other four parameters.
   2. `cutout`: Create a box in a random position on the image.
   
   The other 4 parameters are betewen 0 and 1 and represents the size of the boxes.
   
   There are 2 extra parameters:
  1. `num_patches`: It can be a number or a range and by default is 1.
  2. `use_colour`: The colour of the patches, a value between 0 and 255. If negative or greater than 255
                    it will use noise. By default is noise.
- <b>posterisation</b>: (min_number_levels, max_number_levels) 
            Values are between 1 and 256. The idea is that each pixel can have a value between 0 and 255, so there are
            256 possible values. Posteristion is to crete a new image with less possible values.
- <b>rgb_swapping</b>: No values
- <b>rotation</b>: (min angle, max angle) 

                Both values are in degrees. It performs a rotation of the image.
- <b>sample_pairing</b>: (min_weight, max_weight, mix_images, mix_labels). 

                        The values for min_weight and max_weight must be between 0 and 1.
                        mix_images and mix_labels are a list of images and a list of one hot vectors representing the
                         labels of each mix_image. The mix_images and mix_labels are going to be used to be combined
                        with the original images linearly. The equation is weight * original_image + (1 - weight) * other_image.
                         For each input image a random image from mix_image and its correspondent mix_label will be 
                         selected for the operation.
- <b>sharpness</b>: (min_value, max_value) 
                    
                    The values must be between -5 and 5, 1 means no changes oer the original image.
- <b>shear</b>: (type, magnitude_min, magnitude_max) 
                Types are "random", 'hor', 'ver'. The magnitude are the angles to shear in degrees, so between 0 and 360
- <b>skew</b>: (type, magnitude_min, magnitude_max), 
                    Types are: "TILT", "TILT_LEFT_RIGHT", "TILT_TOP_BOTTOM", "CORNER", "RANDOM", "ALL".
                       The magnitude are values from 0 to 1.
- <b>solarise</b>: No values. It performs solarisation (max(image) - image)
- <b>translate</b>: (min_x, max_x, min_y, max_y) 

                    The values are relative to the size of the image. So they must be between -1 and 1. 
                    The operation displaces an image filling the new part with noise or a given colour. 
                    As extra values it can use:
     1. `use_colour`: The colour of the patches, a value between 0 and 255. If negative or greater than 255
                    it will use noise. By default is noise.  
- <b>zoom</b>: (min value, max value) 
            The values are relative to the current size. So, 1 is the real size image (standard 0.9, 1.1)

### Extra values
In order to use the augmentation, one needs to create an object of Augmentor and populat it with a dictionary.
The minimum requirement are the values specified above, but one could add extra values. In the
previous list the extra values for a specific operations are explained. However there is one extra parameter
that can always be used.
- <b>probability</b>: This is the probability of using the operation, by default is 1, unless the operation
                        does not have any value and it will always return the same image, then the default probability
                        is 0.5. Currently, these operations are : flip, greyscale and solarise.


### Initialising augmentation
```
from Augmentation import Augmentor
config = {'brightness': (0.5,5.0),   # This operation uses standard extra parameters.
            'occlusion': {'values': ('cutout', 0.05, 0.1, 0.1, 0.15), 'probability':0.2},  # Using a dictionary allows passing the extra parameters.
}
augmentor = Augmentor(config)

```

Notice that 
```
config = {'brightness': (0.5,5.0)}
```
is the same as
```
config = {'brightness': {'values': (0.5,5.0)}}
```

## Applying the operations on images
Once the pipeline has been stablished, the image can be augmented by calling
the `run` method.
```
images_aug = augmentor.run(images, mask_positions=[], labels=[])
```

The extra parameters for the `run` method are:

- <b>mask_positions</b>: This parameter is used to specified that an image is a segmentation mask. The implication is that
                        some operations will not be performed and some other will be perfome differently. For instance,
                        operations that modifies the images intensities will not be applied like `contrast`, `illumination`, 
                        `solarise`, `posterise` etc... On the other hand, operations that perform a occlusion of a part of the
                        image will always use black patches regardless the user selecting noise for the patch.
- <b>labels</b>: It represents the labels of the image when using classification. This is useful for operations
                like the `sample_pairing`. Notice that one_hot vector should beb used, the reason is that `sample_pairing`
                average images and labels to create new samples and this weigted average does not make sense for one-number
                label.
